## How To Play

To play this game, visit http://fuentism.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player left, right, up or down.
The goal of the game is to get the highest score you can. Increase your score by
collecting gems (blue are worth 5 points and yellow are worth 10). For every 20
points you will go up one level. Collecting hearts will give you extra lives.
Touch a gross bug and lose a life. That's it!

I also watched several of the OOJS videos about 500 times
